# About Me

Hi, I’m Tim!

With a passion for ecological conservations and re-establish healthy connections between the natural world and us, I am driven to get involved with environmental science or wildlife conservation efforts. I recently graduated with a Honours Bachelor of Science degree (HBSc) from the University of Toronto, majoring in statistical sciences and minoring in mathematics and history and philosophy of science and technology (HPST).

## Portfolio: Written Communication and Critical Reasoning

### Discipline: Environmental Science

> ### [Essay: Causes of the Ecological Crisis](https://github.com/Not20913/TimWang/blob/341c1c956fee50336339cb225bb6d832176c5202/Tim%20Wang%20-%20Causes%20of%20the%20Ecological%20Crisis.pdf)

> ### [Essay: Addressing the Ecological Crisis](https://github.com/Not20913/TimWang/blob/341c1c956fee50336339cb225bb6d832176c5202/Tim%20Wang%20-%20Addressing%20the%20Ecological%20Crisis.pdf)

Well-being is arguably what all living things strive for. Unfortunately, human activities are causing a global decline of wellbeing – the ecological crisis. These essays discuss the key causes of the ecological crisis and approaches to combat it. These essays are reflections of my ecological perspective and demonstrate effective communication skills, and were guided by discussions in a remarkable environmental science course I took.

###  Discipline: History and Philosophy of Science and Technology (HPST)

#### Theme: COVID-19: Epistemology and Societal Implications

> [**Essay: Conspiracy Theories and the COVID-19 Pandemic**](https://github.com/Not20913/TimWang/blob/13ef4548b96b3404142d8ad4ec4d5e1b6b3704af/HPS371%20Long%20Essay.pdf)

#### Theme: History and Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence

> [**Essay: Differences Between Autonomy for Artificial Intelligence and Human Autonomy**](https://github.com/Not20913/TimWang/blob/main/Tim%20Wang%20-%20Autonomy%20for%20AI%20and%20Human%20Autonomy.pdf) 

> [**Essay: The Problems with Defining Intelligence**](https://github.com/Not20913/TimWang/blob/main/Tim%20Wang%20-%20The%20Problems%20with%20Defining%20Intelligence.pdf) 

#### Theme: History and Philosophy of Mathematics

> [**Essay: The Handling of Imaginary Numbers by Cardano and Bomballi**](https://github.com/Not20913/TimWang/blob/main/Tim%20Wang%20-%20The%20Handling%20of%20Imaginary%20Numbers%20of%20Cardano%20and%20Bombelli.pdf)

Scientific theories and practices are at the forefront of our understanding of the universe, but I believe that no single theory can tell the whole story. Hence understanding the history and philosophy behind science is also important, as it teaches us not only it's insights, but also, it’s limits. Furthermore, communicating ideas effectively through writing is important. This includes addressing the audience in the appropriate way, formulating arguments logically with supporting evidence, having a well-organized structure and etc. These paper which I wrote in various history and philosophy courses showcases some of these skills. Each of the topics are explained in the introductions of each paper, and most should be easily digestible without excessive subject specific knowledge. 

## Portfolio: Statistics and Data Science

> ### [Project 1: Toronto Covid-19 Data Exploration](https://github.com/Not20913/PCV/blob/main/sta303_data-exploration_task_completed.pdf)

This project is about visualizing the reported cases of Covid-19 in Toronto in three different circumstances through coding. In the three sections of codes, I recreated a histogram of reported cases by dates, a histogram of cases by outbreak type and week, and three maps that shows low-income information and Covid-19 case information by neighborhood separately and together in one map. The project also includes my codes for the data wrangling section which prepared data frames that were suitable for data visualization.

> ### [Project 2: Data Analysis of a Fictional Company](https://github.com/Not20913/TimWang/blob/main/STA303%20Final%20Project.pdf)

This group project is a focused on using descriptive and inferential statistics to answer the question of fairness in promotion, salary, and hiring processes of a fictional company *Black Saber* given nothing but the relevant data and context. This project demonstrates applied statistics, and scientific communication skills.
