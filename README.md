# About Me

Hi, I'm Yi Zhe Wang! (but I also go by "Tim")

I'm a third-year student at the University of Toronto, majoring in statistical sciences and minoring in mathematics and history and philosophy of sciences. Scientific theories and practices are powerful tools, but I believe that no single account can tell the whole story. This is why understanding the history and philosophy behind science is also important, as it teaches us not only it's power, but also it's limits. 

## Portfolio: Statistics and Data Science

> ### [Project 1: Toronto Covid-19 Data Exploration](https://github.com/Not20913/PCV/blob/main/sta303_data-exploration_task_completed.pdf)

This project is about visualizing the reported cases of Covid-19 in Toronto in three different circumstances through coding. In the three sections of codes, I recreated a histogram of reported cases by dates, a histogram of cases by outbreak type and week, and three maps that shows low-income information and Covid-19 case information by neighborhood separately and together in one map. The project also includes my codes for the data wrangling section which prepared data frames that were suitable for data visualization.

## Portfolio: History and Philosophy of Science

Communicating ideas effectively through writing is important. This includes addressing the audience in the appropriate way, formulating arguments logically with supporting evidence, having a well-organized structure and etc. These paper which I wrote in various history and philosophy courses hopefully showcases some of these skills. Each of the topics should be easily digestible without subject specific knowledge, and are explained in the introductions.
