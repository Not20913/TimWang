# About Me

Hi, I’m Yi Zhe Wang! (but I also go by “Tim”)

I'm a fourth-year student at the University of Toronto, majoring in statistical sciences and minoring in mathematics and history and philosophy of sciences. Beyond that, and more importantly, I am passionate about ecological conservations and re-establish a healthy connection between the natural world and us.

Scientific theories and practices are at the forefront of our understanding of the universe, but I believe that no single theory can tell the whole story. Hence understanding the history and philosophy behind science is also important, as it teaches us not only it's insights, but also, it’s limits. Afterall, taking interdisciplinary approaches allow us to visualize the current ecological crisis in a new light, and provide fresh insights on creative solutions for problems that matters the most.


## Portfolio: Statistics and Data Science

> ### [Project 1: Toronto Covid-19 Data Exploration](https://github.com/Not20913/PCV/blob/main/sta303_data-exploration_task_completed.pdf)

This project is about visualizing the reported cases of Covid-19 in Toronto in three different circumstances through coding. In the three sections of codes, I recreated a histogram of reported cases by dates, a histogram of cases by outbreak type and week, and three maps that shows low-income information and Covid-19 case information by neighborhood separately and together in one map. The project also includes my codes for the data wrangling section which prepared data frames that were suitable for data visualization.

## Portfolio: History and Philosophy of Science

Communicating ideas effectively through writing is important. This includes addressing the audience in the appropriate way, formulating arguments logically with supporting evidence, having a well-organized structure and etc. These paper which I wrote in various history and philosophy courses hopefully showcases some of these skills. Each of the topics are explained in the introductions of each paper, and most should be easily digestible without subject specific knowledge.
